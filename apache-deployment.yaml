#   but it does not like multiple yaml docs, so cut each doc at the --- line before submitting
#   leave the default output of json, since kubernetes converts yaml to json internally

kind: Service
# A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
# For Kubernetes-native applications a simple Endpoints API is updated whenever the set of Pods 
#   in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers a virtual-IP-based bridge 
#   to Services which redirects to the backend Pods. Is a layer 4 construct. 
#
# An ingress controller is a collection of routing rules that govern how external users 
#  access services running in a Kubernetes cluster. Is a layer 7 construct.

# Cluster managers, hosting providers, etc should use tools which respect Pod Disruption Budgets 
#   by calling the Eviction API instead of directly deleting pods, for voluntary actions.

# The kubectl drain command utilized pod disruption budgets
# Pods which are deleted or unavailable due to a rolling upgrade to an application do count 
#   against the disruption budget, but controllers (like deployment and stateful-set) are not 
#   limited by PDBs when doing rolling upgrade.
